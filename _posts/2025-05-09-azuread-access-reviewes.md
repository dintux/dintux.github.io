# 🔐 Keeping Group Access Secure with Azure AD Access Reviews

In today’s hybrid work environment, user access needs are constantly changing — people join projects, leave teams, or even exit the company. But too often, their access sticks around long after it's needed. This kind of *access creep* is a common security risk — and when it involves external or guest users, the risk grows even more.

That’s where **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Access Reviews** come in. Think of them as your automated, recurring access checkpoint — helping you clean up group memberships, reduce insider threats, and enforce least privilege without spending hours doing it manually.

Let’s walk through a real-world example of how to set this up securely and efficiently.

## 👥 Scenario: Securing Group Access in Contoso

You manage a Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) tenant for **Git.com**. There’s a security group called **Group1**, used for access to sensitive resources. Here's what we know:

- Group1 has **50 members**, including **20 guest users** (external collaborators).
- Membership is **assigned manually**, not dynamic.
- You want to **review this group every 3 months** to make sure only the right people still have access.

### **Security Requirements:**
1. Reviews must run **automatically every quarter**.
2. **Each member must confirm** whether they still need access.
3. If someone says **“I don’t need this anymore”**, they should be **removed automatically**.
4. If someone **doesn’t respond at all**, they should also be **removed**.

This isn’t just cleanup — it’s proactive **access governance** that helps reduce your attack surface.

## ✅ The Solution: Azure AD Access Reviews

Microsoft Entra’s **Access Reviews** are purpose-built for this kind of security hygiene. They let you schedule recurring checks on group memberships — and automate the outcomes based on user input (or lack thereof).

Let’s set this up.

## 🔧 How to Set Up Access Reviews for Group1

### Step 1: Make Sure You Have the Right License
Access Reviews require an **Azure AD Premium P2** license. This unlocks Identity Governance capabilities.

### Step 2: Go to the Access Reviews Dashboard
1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Identity Governance** > **Access Reviews**.
3. Click **+ New access review**.

### Step 3: Configure the Review

- **Review name**: *Group1 Access Review – Quarterly*
- **Scope**: Teams + Groups
- **Target group**: Select **Group1**
- **Reviewers**: Set to **“Members (self-review)”** — users will decide if they still need access.
- **Recurrence**: Set this to **Quarterly**.
- **Review duration**: Choose **14 or 30 days** to give users time to respond.

### Step 4: Automate the Results for Security

- **Auto-apply results**: ✅ Yes — ensures actions are taken without waiting for admin approval.
- **If no response**: ❌ Remove user — this is key to maintaining zero standing access.
- **Require justification on approval**: Optional, but good for audit logs.
- **Send notifications**: 📧 Yes — users will get emails with links to complete the review.

### Step 5: Launch the Review

- Double-check the settings and click **Start**. 
- Azure will now automatically launch this review every 3 months going forward.

## 🔐 Why This Matters for Security

Without regular access reviews, old permissions pile up. That’s a gold mine for attackers — especially if a stale guest account is compromised or a former employee still has backdoor access.

By using Access Reviews:

- 🔄 You ensure **access is continuously right-sized**.
- 📉 You reduce your **insider threat exposure**.
- 🔍 You gain an **audit trail** showing that you’re enforcing least privilege.
- ⚙️ You automate what used to be a painful manual process.

It’s security and efficiency in one.

Security isn’t just about firewalls and detection tools — it’s also about **access control hygiene**. With Azure AD Access Reviews, you’re putting guardrails in place to make sure only the right people have the right access at the right time — and that no one slips through the cracks.

If you’re serious about **least privilege, zero trust**, and **identity-first security**, this is one of the smartest tools to implement.
