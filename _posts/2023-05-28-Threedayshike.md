##  The Hike Begins

We set off into the lush cloud forest of Sri Lanka, legs heavy and hearts eager. It had been a while since I’d done something this physically demanding — and my body wasn’t shy about reminding me. This was more than just a walk. It was cardio, and it hit hard right out of the gate. But being surrounded by misty trees and birdsong, I knew we were in for something special.

## Feeling the Strain

The first hour was rough. Muscles protested. Breathing got heavier. But somewhere between the sweat and short breaks, it started to feel good. Familiar. Like returning to an old rhythm I’d forgotten I loved. The forest was quiet except for our footsteps and the occasional rustle in the underbrush.

## First Night: Shelter in the Wild

By evening, we found an abandoned house deep inside the forest — weathered, half-forgotten, and perfect. With just a roof over our heads and the forest at our doorstep, it became our sanctuary for the night. There was something comforting about its stillness, as though the forest had kept it for wanderers like us.

##  Dinner from the Forest

That night, we cooked together — dhal and rice, warmed over a small fire. But the highlight was the wild-foraged **Gotukola salad**, plucked fresh from nearby undergrowth. The flavors were earthy and sharp, and every bite felt like a celebration of where we were.

##  Day Two Begins

Waking up surrounded by trees and cool mist was rejuvenating. I felt incredible — like my body had adjusted to the forest’s rhythm. We packed up, took one last look at the shelter that had been our home, and said a quiet goodbye before moving on.

##  First Waterfall Discovery

Not long into day two, we heard it — the unmistakable rush of water. And then, just like that, we stumbled upon a waterfall hidden in the trees. One of thousands, probably. Its power and beauty caught us in silence. These are the moments you hike for.

##  Second Night: Streamside Camping

As dusk fell, we found a calm stream and decided it would be our home for the night. We pitched our tent right beside it, the sound of running water becoming our lullaby. No noise pollution. No walls. Just nature — pure and uninterrupted.

##  Million-Star Hotel

The sky opened that night. Stars spilled out across it in a way that made you forget everything else. We lay beside the stream, looking up in awe. No man-made structure could match this feeling. This was luxury — a million-star hotel, and we had it all to ourselves.

##  Cooking by the Stream

Dinner was noodles, cooked over a small flame. Nothing fancy, but after a long day of walking, it was perfect. We ate slowly, letting the sound of the stream and the crackle of fire fill the silence between us.

##  Another Hidden Waterfall

The next day brought more surprises. As we moved deeper into the forest, another waterfall appeared — this one cascading through rocks with an effortless grace. They seemed endless, each one inviting us to pause, admire, and remember.

##  And Another – "San Sun Ella"

Later, we reached **San Sun Ella** — *the Calm Waterfall*. It lived up to its name. Water flowed gently down the rock face, and the surrounding air was still, almost reverent. It felt sacred in a way. We stood there for a long time, soaking it in.

##  The Final Stretch & Saying Goodbye

We kept walking, the end drawing near. The trail began to feel familiar now — not in the sense of memory, but of belonging. The forest wasn’t just a place we passed through anymore. It felt like it had accepted us, in its quiet, ancient way.

After three days, we stepped out of the forest — changed. My body was tired, sure, but my spirit was wide awake. Leaving wasn’t easy. A part of me had rooted itself in that mist, in those trees, in the waterfalls. I felt like I’d become part of it, and it of me.
